# ISC4U-Summative June 10 2023 Patch


* In this commit, the Users class remained the same. So, we decided to create a class to do actions with Books. We created a books.txt file with contains 'books' in the format title/author/pg number where we can store all the books in the database. The books class for now allows you to see the books available to you organized in a table using HTML. The creation of this table also depends on what user-type is signed when they click on the view books button. In LibraryGUI class,  action listeners were added to the button concerning viewing books
