# ISC4U-Summative

* An admin panel was added in this patch so that users of both types when signed in get shown a frame. The admin panel has more buttons(do nothing yet), but they look the same. Additionally, the table created in Users.java in the LAST commit has now been able to get the contents of the text file and put it on the table. Action Listeners were added to ONE of the buttons on the User panel to accommodate.
